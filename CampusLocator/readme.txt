2024_25 - Let's Hack Leicester - Student Pack

Campus essentials locator

interactive map webpage/app that highlights lesser-known/underrated spots on campus such as water dispenser, bike racks, quiet study areas, microwaves etc. Digital “insider guide” to campus that new or busy students would love

Features that could be implemented:

-Point-of-Interest (POI) Mapping:

-List specific campus locations for each category, like “Bike Parking,” “Water Refill Stations,” “Microwave Stations,” and “Quiet Study Spots.”

-Using a simple array or list in C#, store each POI’s name, type, and location (you could keep it basic by referencing nearby buildings).

-Basic Filtering:
  Add a filter system so users can choose to view just one type of location at a time (e.g., only show water dispensers). This could be a simple button-toggling system in your UI.

-Map Integration (Optional):

-User Contributions (Future Potential):
 As an optional add-on, you could allow users to suggest new POI locations, building a community-driven resource hub. 

-If time allows, integrate a basic map view where users see a visual representation of campus with pins for each POI. If maps are too complex, stick to a list or grid format for simplicity.
 Leaflet for maps on a web page Backend Logic: Use C# or Java for handling the app’s backend, like storing and retrieving map points. C# might be easier here since you’re already familiar with it.

-Frontend/UI: JavaScript for a web-based map using Leaflet or Unity with C# for a desktop/mobile app. Python could assist in data handling if the team decides to create a database.

-Data Storage: A lightweight database like SQLite (manageable with Python or C#) would work for storing the locations and user data. You could even opt for JSON if you want a simple, file-based approach.
